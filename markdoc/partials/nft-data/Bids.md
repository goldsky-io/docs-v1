## Bids

On the Goldsky platform, users have the ability to view top bids -â€” these are the highest ongoing propositions for any NFT in a given collection.

Currently, top bids from the Blur marketplace are incorporated into the platform. We are constantly looking to expand our marketplace coverage and include various bid types.

The array containing the top bids can be located in the field `top_bids` in the Collection Table, available in the "NFT by..." queries, and also direct in the Collections by Wallet query.
