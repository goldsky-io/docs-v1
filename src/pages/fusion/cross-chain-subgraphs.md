For protocols that stretch across multiple chains, it can be a challenge processing events from different sources in a normalized way. With Cross-chain Subgraphs, you just have one source of truth and the ability to query it with GraphQL or SQL using our various [Mirrors](/mirror).

To get started, start indexing your subgraphs on our platform, then contact us so we can help you integrate that data in the best way possible.

## Examples

[Multi-chain Instant Subgraphs](/references/instant-subgraphs-config#multi-chain) are a great example of where cross-chain subgraphs provides a convenient way to query data through a single interface.
