With [cross-chain subgraphs](/fusion/cross-chain-subgraphs), you can merge the same subgraph across multiple chains into a single API to query it.

For even more flexibility and the-sky-is-the-limit customization options, [Transforms](/fusion/transforms) let you write SQL to transform your data in real-time. Joins, aggregations, group by - you name it.
