## Quick start

To get started with Goldsky:

1. Create an account at [app.goldsky.com](https://app.goldsky.com "target=hello").
1. Choose a plan that best fits your needs.
1. Create an API key on the [Settings page](https://app.goldsky.com/dashboard/settings).
1. Install the Goldsky CLI:
   ```shell
   npm install -g @goldskycom/cli
   ```
1. Log in with the API key created earlier:
   ```shell
   goldsky login
   ```
1. Deploy your subgraph
   ```shell
   cd <your-subgraph-directory>
   graph build # Build your subgraph as normal.
   goldsky subgraph deploy my-subgraph/1.0.0
   ```
   Alternatively, if you have public subgraphs deployed to **The Graphâ€™s hosted service**, the following command seamlessly migrates your subgraph to Goldsky:
   ```shell
   goldsky subgraph deploy your-subgraph-name/your-version --from-url <your-subgraph-query-url>
   ```
   [Learn more](/migrate-from-the-graph) about migrating from The Graph.
1. Access data
   ```shell
   goldsky subgraph list
   ```
   Open the "GraphQL API" link in your browser to access your data
