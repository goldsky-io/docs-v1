The quickest way to get started with Goldsky Indexing is with [Shared Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/shared-subgraph-indexing).

When you need improved customizability and performance, Goldsky offers Dedicated Subgraph Indexing.

As the name suggests, this is a dedicated environment for you and you only. Thanks to that, we can customize indexing to your needs. This includes, for example, indexing subgraphs on private chains.

But wait, there is more... For the ultimate freedom on how to index your data, please have a look at [Direct Data Indexing](/indexing/direct-data-indexing).
