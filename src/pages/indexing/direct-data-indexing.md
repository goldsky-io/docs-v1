If [Shared Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/shared-subgraph-indexing) is a ðŸš² and [Dedicated Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/dedicated-subgraph-indexing) a ðŸš—, then Direct Data Indexing is a ðŸš€!

You get real-time, re-org aware streams of blocks, transactions, traces, and decoded logs.

Track all tokens and NFTs, merge with subgraphs, and create [complex streams](/fusion) with the combined data.

## Benefits

Compared to shared or dedicated subgraph indexing, Goldsky's Direct Data Indexing offers the following benefits:

- âœ… No need to create subgraphs
- âœ… Provide us with ABIs and we'll rapidly decode all relevant logs.
- âœ… Query non-smart contract related data, such as individual blocks and raw transactions
