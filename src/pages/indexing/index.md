Goldsky provides the following options to index data:

- [Instant Subgraphs](/indexing/instant-subgraphs)
- [Shared Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/shared-subgraph-indexing)
- [Dedicated Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/dedicated-subgraph-indexing)
- [Direct Data Indexing](/indexing/direct-data-indexing)

From top to bottom, each offers better performance and improved customizability to grow with your project's complexity.

We also provide [webhooks](/indexing/webhooks) that trigger based on entity changes in your deployed subgraphs.
