title: Shared Subgraph Indexing
description: Index subgraphs in our default infrastructure.
---

This is the default indexing infrastructure Goldsky provides. It's a fully auto-scaled environment shared among anyone who uses shared subgraph indexing.

- Optimized RPC multi-provider layer with a global cache that uses a combination of dedicated and commercial RPC APIs for uptime
- I/O optimized database with under 1ms average commit times

If you prefer a completely isolated and dedicated infrastructure, please review [Dedicated Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/dedicated-subgraph-indexing).
