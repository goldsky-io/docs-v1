title: Shared Subgraph Indexing
description: Index subgraphs in our default infrastructure.

This is the default indexing infrastructure Goldsky provides. It's a fully auto-scaled environment shared among anyone who uses shared subgraph indexing.

If you prefer a completely isolated, dedicated infrastructure, please review [Dedicated Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/dedicated-subgraph-indexing).
