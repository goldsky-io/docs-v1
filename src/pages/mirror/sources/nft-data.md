Our NFT Metadata dataset is an incredibly comprehensive scraped and derived metadata including:

- Image metadata
- Royalty metadata
- Floor price and previous sales
- Transfers
- Off-chain and on-chain Bids/Sales
- Rarity

As a mirror source, you'd be able to sink it into any of our supported sinks, as well as do transformations and aggregations on the dataset.

This dataset is in technical preview - it's in production with pilot customers, but subject to change.

[Email us](mailto:support@goldsky.com) if you'd like to join our technical preview program.
