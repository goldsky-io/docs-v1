## Rarity Table

The Goldsky platform uses the OpenRarity standard to calculate a consistent, mathematically-based rarity score for NFTs.

Currently, the system supports ERC-721 and Metaplex non-fungible token standards. Support for ERC-1155 is expected soon.

**Rarity Table**:

Field | Description | Type(s)
--- | --- | ---
rank | Rarity rank, relative to the scores of all other NFTs in the collection | int / null
score | Raw rarity score | float / null
unique_attributes | The number of unique attributes, or traits, if any, that this NFT possesses | int / null
