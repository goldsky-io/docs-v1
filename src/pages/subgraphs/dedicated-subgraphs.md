title: Dedicated Subgraphs
description: Index your subgraphs - even on private chains - on dedicated infrastructure for improved customizability and performance.

When you make a new subgraph on Goldsky, by default it's hosted on our highly resilient [Shared Subgraph Platform](/indexing/shared-subgraphs).

When you need improved customizability and performance, Goldsky offers Dedicated Subgraph Indexing. This is a dedicated environment for you and you only, allowing for customization and optimization at both the indexing and querying layers.

**Indexing enhancements**

- support for private chains
- custom RPC layer optimizations methods based on subgraph needs to improve indexing speed

**Querying Enhancements**

- enable caching with custom rules
- custom database optimizations to speed up specific query patterns, bringing expensive queries down from seconds to milliseconds

To launch a dedicated indexer, please contact us via email at [support@goldsky.com](mailto:support@goldsky.com) to get started.
