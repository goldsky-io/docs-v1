The quickest way to get started with Goldsky Indexing is with [Shared Subgraph Indexing](/indexing/shared-subgraph-indexing).

When you need improved customizability and performance, Goldsky offers Dedicated Subgraph Indexing. As the name suggests, this is a dedicated environment for you and you only, allowing for customization and optimization at both the indexing and querying layers.

**Customized indexing**

- support for private chains
- custom RPC layer optimizations methods based on subgraph needs to improve indexing speed

**Customized querying**

- enable caching with custom rules
- custom database optimizations to speed up specific query patterns, bringing expensive queries down from seconds to milliseconds
