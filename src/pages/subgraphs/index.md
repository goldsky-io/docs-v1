Goldsky provides a completely backwards-compatible subgraph indexing solution.

The core of the indexing uses exactly the same WASM processing layer, with a rewritten RPC layer, an autoscaling query layer, and storage optimizations focused on reliability.

You can expect indexing speeds up to 6x faster, with enterprise-grade reliability, and consistently fast response times.
