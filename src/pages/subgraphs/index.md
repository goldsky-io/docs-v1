Goldsky provides the following options to deploy subgraphs:

- [Instant Subgraphs](/subgraphs/instant-subgraphs)
- [Shared Subgraphs](/subgraphs/shared-subgraphs)
- [Dedicated Subgraphs](/subgraphs/dedicated-subgraphs)

From top to bottom, each offers better performance and improved customizability to grow with your project's complexity.

We also provide [webhooks](/subgraphs/webhooks) that trigger based on entity changes in your deployed subgraphs.
