description: Index subgraphs in our default infrastructure.

This is the default subgraphs infrastructure Goldsky provides. It's a fully auto-scaled environment shared among anyone who uses shared subgraphs.

If you prefer a completely isolated, dedicated infrastructure, please review [Dedicated Subgraphs](/subgraphs/dedicated-subgraphs).
